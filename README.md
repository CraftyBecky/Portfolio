# About
Rebeckah (Becky) McDaniel's Portfolio - July 2022
Made with Bootstrap

As I prepare to start looking for a developer position, I knew it was time to get started on my portfolio. I also decided to use this opportunity to learn Bootstrap 5. 
I attempted to try building with just a CDN but this was proving to not be affective if I also wanted to use SCSS/SASS. So with the help of my mentor, we spent and evening
and installed NPM/ Node.js. At least half of what I did on my portfolio was done for this first time. 


# Things I learned

How to compile SCSS into VSCode

Modal/popup help - As I wanted to be able to have an image visible for my project
This was my first time creating a modal
I spent a little while trying to figure out how to get my image into the Bootstrap modal

Once I could not get the image to fit within the modal, I added the img-fluid class to the image itself and then found out how to make the image wider, in order to see
the entire image. This was through Stack Overflow that helped me figure that out.
